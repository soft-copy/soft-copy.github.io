<p>This
white paper is about a real technology, but not a real company.</p>



<h2>Thorium – Providing Power Now and for Our Next
Thousand Years</h2>



<p>Human
civilization depends on safe, inexpensive electrical power free of
harm to the health of humans or our ecosystem.</p>



<p>Increased
world GDP (well-being) is linked directly to increased use of power.
We have made great progress in generating and using power, but, much
of the world still lives in deep poverty. Also, current methods of
generating power severely harm human health and the environment.</p>



<ul><li>
consult on other needs.Fossil fuels
	power much of our world, but they pollute air and water, and
	drilling for them and mining them harms the landscape.
	</li><li>
Hydroelectric power can only be used
	in places with rivers, and it disrupts the flow of rivers and
	interferes with fish migrations. Also, in one terrible case in
	China, it led to flooding killing hundreds of thousands.
	</li><li>
Solar and wind power are limitless,
	but are not available at all times, kill large numbers of birds and
	bats, and need large areas of land and huge amounts of construction.
</li></ul>



<p>Nuclear
power is clean, very safe, and reliable. But, as used now, it needs
costly preparation of fuels, and complicated and expensive handling
of waste.  Nuclear can be made even safer.</p>



<p>How
can we make more, safe, power (especially electrical power)
available? By using thorium as fuel in molten-salt reactors.  Liquid
fluoride thorium reactors (LFTR’s) can produce electrical power and
process heat for industry. 
</p>



<p>Thorium
is nearly as common as lead. Unlike uranium, thorium needs no
isotopic refinement to be used as fuel. 
</p>



<p>Using
molten salt reactors greatly simplifies waste disposal and improves
safety.</p>



<p>This
can be done  at a cost per kilowatt-hour as low as coal, using
well-tested technology.</p>



<p><sidebar>
Uranium mined from the earth has two isotopes, U-238 (99.3%) and
U-235 (0.7%).  Only U-235 is used as fuel, so mined uranium has to be
highly refined to remove U-238.</p>



<p>Thorium
mined from the earth has only one isotope, so no costly refinement is
needed.</p>



<p></sidebar></p>



<h3>The Challenge</h3>



<p>This
paper discusses how leading companies are designing molten salt
reactors (MSR’s) using thorium, to quickly and safely begin power
generation, and also make very valuable fission products.</p>



<p>The
results? Inexpensive electrical power, process heat, desalinated
water, and fission products that can fight cancer and power
deep-space satellites.</p>



<p>In
the following pages, we take a closer look at how humanity has met
its power needs so far; look at the downsides of pre-nuclear and
current nuclear solutions; review the usefulness of thorium as a
nearly inexhaustible source of power; and examine the benefits of
using thorium as a fuel in liquid form, in an MSR. Finally, we
compare the capital and operating costs of using thorium in LFTR’s
with other ways of generating power.</p>



<p>According
to T. J. Garrett (Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
Utah), world GDP (wealth) is linked directly to the rate of use of
power. According to the United Nations, in mid-2017, the population
of Earth is about 7.5 billion. 836 million people live in extreme
poverty. And, the population is expected to reach 11.2 billion by
2100.</p>



<p><Graphic:
graph showing linear relationship between (a) energy consumption per
person and (b) GDP></p>



<p>Humanity
desperately needs more power per person, for many more people.</p>



<h3>Current Practice</h3>



<h4>Pre-nuclear Sources of Energy</h4>



<p>Before
the industrial revolution, the source of power was mostly food, with
some use of wood, coal, dung, and whale oil, and local use of water
or wind power.</p>



<p>The
steam engine was revolutionary, and enabled massive use of coal and
oil.</p>



<p>The
invention of internal-combustion engines and electrical generators
made fossil fuels even more useful, and led to massive use of
hydroelectric power.</p>



<h5>Shortcomings</h5>



<p>Pre-nuclear
sources and uses of power come with costs.</p>



<p>Burning
coal for power requires environmentally damaging mining, and use of
both coal and fossil fuel pollutes air and water. The U.N. estimates
that over one million people die each year due to particulate
pollution from coal, and this is just one of coal’s health risks.</p>



<p>Hydroelectric
power is limited to areas with rivers, harms wildlife, and has led,
in China, to over 200,000 deaths from flooding.</p>



<p>Solar
and wind power are inexhaustible, but can only be used in certain
places and can only produce power some of the time. They need vast
areas of land, kill huge numbers of birds and bats, and require large
amounts of manufacturing and construction.</p>



<h4>Our Current Nuclear Source of Energy</h4>



<p>Nuclear
power</p>



<ul><li>
delivers over one million times as
	much power per pound of fuel as oil or coal,
	</li><li>
is highly reliable,
	</li><li>
requires very little space, and
	</li><li>
does not pollute our air or water.
</li></ul>



<p>However,
our current practice of using uranium in solid fuel pellets in
water-cooled reactors has many drawbacks.</p>



<p>Uranium
found in nature is a mixture of isotopes: U-238 (99.3%) and U-235
(0.7%). U-235 is the isotope needed for power generation. Separating
useful amounts of U-235 needs costly refinement, and leaves large
amounts of depleted uranium, which needs careful disposal.</p>



<p>Current
nuclear power plants use uranium in solid form, as ceramic pellets
encased in metal fuel rods. Gaseous byproducts, such as xenon, form
cavities in fuel pellets, making the fuel rod useless. Some other
byproducts are extremely radioactive. These could be removed by
reprocessing the fuel pellets, but this is costly and complicated,
and is not done in the United States. Currently, in the United States
(according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), waste is stored,
without being reprocessed, at over 68 locations.</p>



<p>Further,
current nuclear power plants use piped water to gather heat from the
hot core.  This heat is carried to a turbine that generates
electricity. Water normally boils at 100 degrees centigrade, but in
reactors water is pressurized at up to 150 atmospheres. This is done
to keep it from boiling at a working temperature of 325 degrees
centigrade. Leaks at this pressure are mechanical explosions, and can
destroy equipment and buildings, release radioactive steam, and kill
anyone nearby. Also, this steam would instantly expand thousands of
times, carrying radioactive debris, and would need containment and
cleanup.</p>



<h3>A Better Solution</h3>



<p>Thorium,
used in molten salt reactors, is the answer. What are the advantages
of using thorium as fuel in a molten salt reactor?</p>



<ul><li>
Thorium is practically inexhaustible.
	</li><li>
Thorium is safe.
	</li><li>
Thorium is perfectly suited for use
	in molten-salt reactors (MSR’s).
	</li><li>
MSR’s are a tested technology.
	</li><li>
MSR’s are inherently safer than
	solid-fuel water-cooled reactors.
	</li><li>
MSR’s produce far less waste than
	solid-fuel, water-cooled reactors.
	</li><li>
Thorium, used in MSR’s, can provide
	energy at lower cost than coal.
</li></ul>



<h4>Thorium is Abundant.</h4>



<p>Thorium
is about 7.2 parts per million of the Earth’s crust. This is only
slightly rarer than lead, and about three times as common as uranium.
Further, all natural thorium is the useful isotope Th-232. Only 0.7
percent of natural uranium is the isotope useful as fuel, U-235. So,
useful thorium is more than four hundred times as common as useful
uranium. Uranium needs to be enriched to raise its concentration of
U-235, by removing U-238. This removed uranium must be handled
as waste. Thorium needs no isotopic refinement, so no waste is
produced.</p>



<p><Graphic:
How much thorium, vs. how much uranium, with uranium broken down
between U-235 and U-238></p>



<p>Thorium
is a common byproduct of current mining of rare earths. Rare earths
have many uses; for instance, neodymium is widely used in consumer
and military electronics, such as to make ultra-strong magnets. Large
amounts of thorium are currently stored as waste from mining, and the
current price of thorium is about fifty dollars per kilogram. Given
the power density of thorium, the cost of thorium is only a tiny part
of the cost of delivering power.</p>



<p>In
fact, right now, the United States has enough thorium (buried as
“waste” in Nevada) to generate more electrical power than the
U.S. uses in three years. Kirk Sorensen of Flibe Energy estimates
that generating electricity for the current population of Earth, with
each person using as much electricity as an average resident of the
U.S., would need 1500 metric tons of thorium per year. The
International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that the world has
readily available reserves of 1.725 million tons. At 1500 metric tons
per year, this would last 1150 years. Exploration and improvements in
mining technology will make more thorium reserves readily available.</p>



<h4>Thorium is safe.</h4>



<p>Naturally-occurring
thorium has a half-life of 14.05 billion years. Contrary to a common
misunderstanding, longer half-lives are worse. A shorter half-life
means that the energy in a material is released more quickly, which
is more dangerous. For instance, U-235 has a half-life of 70.4
million years (200 times shorter than thorium) U-238 has a half-life
of 4.47 billion years (about one third that of thorium). Even
naturally occurring potassium-40 (a small fraction of all natural
potassium; even in bananas!) is eight times as radioactive as
thorium.</p>



<h4>Thorium can be used in molten-salt reactors.</h4>



<p>Although
uranium was used in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment conducted at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, one finding of the
experiment was that enough neutrons were produced to use thorium as
the fuel source.  
</p>



<p>Thorium
also can be used in MSR’s, and can be used as fuel with neutrons in
the thermal spectrum.  (“Thermal spectrum” means that neutrons
are moving relatively slowly.) 
</p>



<p>Uranium
238 cannot be used as fuel in the thermal spectrum, but can be in the
“fast spectrum”. Unfortunately, use of fast spectrum technology
requires much more radioactive material in a reactor. Also, using
U-238 as fuel leads to more byproducts heavier than plutonium.  These
materials complicate storage of nuclear waste.</p>



<p><Graphic:

<h4>Molten-salt reactors are proven.</h4>



<p>Molten
salt reactors were thoroughly tested at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. The Aircraft Reactor Experiment (1954) proved that MSR’s
worked. The following Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (1965-69) proved
that MSR’s could be used safely and for long periods, and that the
number of neutrons produced would enable use of thorium as fuel.</p>



<h4>Molten-salt reactors are safer than solid-fuel
water-cooled reactors.</h4>



<p>Using
molten salt rather than water to carry heat from the core to a
power-generating turbine is much safer. Water must be highly
pressurized to be kept liquid at useful temperatures. Molten salts do
not need additional pressure to remain liquid. Leaks of molten salt
would not result in a steam explosion, and no radioactive steam and
debris would be released. A leak would result only in a drip, rather
than an explosion, and the salt would simply re-freeze.</p>



<p><Graphic:

<p><Graphic:
comparison (not to scale) of sizes of piping, walls, and containment
required></p>



<h4>Molten-salt reactors produce far less waste than
solid-fueled reactors.</h4>



<p>Nuclear
reactions produce some gaseous byproducts, and these deform solid
fuel pellets and metal fuel rods. Also, radiation degrades some
uranium oxide into uranium metal and oxygen, and this oxygen can
degrade fuel rods. Because of these problems, fuel rods are removed
from service after twelve to eighteen months, with only part of the
uranium in the fuel rods having been consumed.</p>



<p>Molten
salt reactors do not have fuel rods, so none are deformed. So, unlike
solid fuel reactors, which use less than one percent of mined uranium
before rods have to be removed, thorium, used in a molten salt
reactor, can be completely consumed.</p>



<p>With
fuel carried in a liquid, such as molten salt, gaseous fission
byproducts, such as xenon, can simply bubble out rather than causing
pockets in solid fuel pellets. Many other fission byproducts, are
extremely useful (in fighting cancer, or in providing power to
satellites) but cannot be extracted efficiently from solid fuel
pellets, so they are treated as waste. These materials can be
economically extracted from liquid fuels through chemical and
mechanical means, and would not be waste.</p>



<p><Graphic:
comparison of sizes of waste streams, calling out useful isotopes
recoverable from molten salt></p>



<h4>Thorium, used in molten salt reactors, can
provide energy at lower cost than coal.</h4>



<p>According
to Energy from Thorium
(www.energyfromthorium.com/2010/07/11/ending-energy-poverty) the
median capital cost (of five studies) of construction of a molten
salt reactor, per Watt, is $1.92. For comparison, this is well lower
than $2.30 for coal.</p>



<p>Nuclear
fuel is much more energy-dense than fossil fuels. So, the operating
cost of fuel per kilowatt-hour from thorium in an MSR would be around
four thousandths of a cent. This is about one thousand times lower
than coal. Total costs of delivered power would be about three cents
per kilowatt-hour (Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power,
2009).</p>



<h3>Expected Results</h3>



<p>Shifting
to nuclear power from thorium in molten salt reactors will have many
benefits:</p>



<ul><li>
Huge amounts of new power can be
	brought online quickly.
	</li><li>
Replacing coal power with nuclear
	power will clean our air and water.
	</li><li>
Much less mining, which damages our
	landscape, will be needed.
	</li><li>
Using thorium rather than uranium
	will dramatically reduce complexity and cost of refinement of ores
	into fuel. This will eliminate radioactive waste from this step.
	</li><li>
Use of thorium will also reduce the
	production of plutonium and other transuranics. This will radically
	simplifying storage of fission byproducts.
	</li><li>
Cancer-killing bismuth-213 will be
	produced as a byproduct, and can be extracted.
	</li><li>
Reactors and buildings will have much
	lower construction costs and be safer.
	</li><li>
Other precious byproducts will be
	able to be economically extracted, rather than being treated as
	expensive waste.
</li></ul>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<ul><li>
Thorium is so abundant that it can
	provide power for thousands of years. 
	
	</li><li>
Thorium, unlike uranium, requires no
	refinement, and so has no related wastes. 
	
	</li><li>
Thorium is perfectly suited for use
	in molten-salt reactors. These are inherently safer than
	water-cooled reactors. They can operate at normal pressure, and pose
	no risk of mechanical explosion or release of radioactive steam. 
	
	</li><li>
Liquid fuels simplify processing of
	fission byproducts; allow extraction of valuable byproducts; and
	allow the most dangerous byproducts to be burned as fuel.
	</li><li>
Thorium, used in molten salt
	reactors, can provide power at lower cost than any other source,
	including coal and natural gas.
</li></ul>



<h3>How to Decide</h3>



<p>When
considering strategies for generating power for the advancement of
civilization, there are important features of power sources to
consider.</p>



<h4>Is the energy source cost-effective?</h4>



<p>True
costs of solar and wind power are extremely high. These costs are
hidden through subsidies. Thorium in MSR’s can beat all other sources
in providing low-cost power.</p>



<h4>What non-monetary costs are there?</h4>



<p>Solar,
wind, and hydro power all interfere with our ecosystem. Solar farms
burn birds and interfere with aviation. Wind power requires vast
areas of land and huge amounts of construction, and kills huge
numbers of birds and bats. Dams interfere with migrations of
wildlife. 
</p>



<p>Manufacturing
equipment for solar and wind power produces large amounts of
industrial waste. 
</p>



<p>Hydropower
can also lead to catastrophic failures, leading to many deaths. 
</p>



<p>Coal
pollutes air terribly, leading annually to over one million deaths
from related diseases, and poisons grounds and waterways. Further,
coal mining is very dangerous.</p>



<p>Thorium
is easily mined, does not interfere with the ecosystem, and does not
pollute.</p>



<h4>Is the fuel readily available?</h4>



<p>Thorium
is so abundant in the Earth’s crust that every country could be
energy-independent while using as much electricity per person as the
United States. Already, each year, enough thorium is dug up, and
becomes tailings of rare earths mining, to provide power for the
world many times over.</p>



<h4>Does the use of the power source create large
amounts of waste?</h4>



<p>Thorium
requires no isotopic refinement (as does uranium) and so produces no
related waste. Use of molten salt reactors dramatically reduces the
volume, and duration of high radioactivity, of waste, and allows
complete use of fuel.</p>



<h4>Is the power generation system safe?</h4>



<p>Molten
salt reactors cannot melt down. “Melting up” is actually a
required step in the production of power.  Molten salt reactors do
not require pressurization as do water-cooled reactors. This prevents
steam explosions and release of radioactive steam. Electrical power
failures at a power plant would lead, through gravity, to the
draining, cooling, and freezing of the fuel.</p>



<h4>Considering these questions – 
</h4>



<p>Thorium,
used in molten salt reactors, uniquely meets all these criteria.</p>



<h3>Next Step</h3>



<p>If
you are ready to move forward with a program to provide enough
electrical power to bring all of humanity up to a civilized standard
of living, and provide that power for a millennium or more, we look
forward to working with you!</p>



<p>We
will discuss the requirements for building a proof-of-concept
reactor. This will extend the learnings from the Molten Salt Reactor
Experiment. We will also discuss the requirements for building the
first few of our Hammer Class production civilian reactors. These
will provide power for human civilization.</p>



<p>You
can take a useful, extremely profitable part!</p>

<p>Bare
sustenance requires about 200 Watts per person.  Civilization
requires much more power, most of it electrical.</p>



<p>At
present, humanity uses about 16,000 gigawatts, or about 2100 watts
per person. The United States uses about 10 kilowatts per person,
with 4.3% of the world’s population.</p>



<p>To
bring energy availability for all humans to the level of the U.S.
would require generation of a total of 75,000 gigawatts, an increase
of 59,000 gigawatts.</p>



<p>If,
as the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs
predicts, the world population increases to 11.2 billion by 2100, a
total of 112,000 gigawatts (an increase from the present of 96,000
gigawatts) will be required to provide power for all at the rate
currently provided in the United States.</p>

<p>The
Story of the ARE, MSRE, Plutonium</p>



<p>Alvin
Weinberg helped develop the light water reactor during World War 2 in
order to produce plutonium for bombs. He saw risks in the use of
solid fuel with water as the heat transport fluid. Weinberg proposed
research into liquid-fueled reactors for generation of electrical
power for civilian use.  To get funding, Weinberg proposed
development of a nuclear-powered bomber. He then directed the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE), using molten salt to carry
dissolved fuel, at Oak Ridge in 1954.</p>



<p>The
ARE was successful. This led to the follow-on Molten Salt Reactor
Experiment (MSRE), which validated use of an MSR to generate power
for civilian use.</p>



<p>However,
the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was shut down by the U.S.
government. This was done to concentrate resources on development of
fast-breeder plutonium reactors, for production of plutonium for
weapons, and with a hope to use fast breeders. Fast breeders could
use a (U-238)-(neptunium-239)-(plutonium-239) cycle similar to the
(Th-232)-(protactinium-233)-(U-233) cycle. However, fast breeders
have had many dangerous failures.</p>



<h4>Sidebar 3</h4>



<p>“Our
economic goal is to achieve a cost of electrical energy averaged over
the life of the power station to be no more than that from burning
fossil fuels at the same location. Past studies have shown a
potential for the molten salt reactor to be somewhat lower in cost of
electricity than both coal and LWRs. There are several reasons for
substantial cost savings: low pressure operation, low operations and
maintenance costs, lack of fuel fabrication, easy fuel handling, low
fissile inventory…” (Ralph Moir and Edward Teller)</p>
